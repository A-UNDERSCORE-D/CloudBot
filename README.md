# CloudBot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot.svg?branch=python3.4)](https://travis-ci.org/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/badge.png?branch=python3.4)](https://coveralls.io/r/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot?branch=python3.4)

CloudBot Refresh is the newest generation of CloudBot, the fun, fast, extendable Python IRC bot!

## Installing CloudBot

Firstly, CloudBot will only run on **Python 3.4 or higher**. Because we use the asyncio module, you will not be able to use any other versions of Python.

To install CloudBot on *nix (linux, etc), see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-*nix)

To install CloudBot on Windows, see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-Windows)

If you're going to be actively developing on CloudBot, and submitting PRs back, you can run CloudBot inside Vagrant. This allows everyone to have an identical development environment.

To install CloudBot in Vagrant (both *Unix and Windows), see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-with-Vagrant)


### Running CloudBot

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

```
python3.4 -m cloudbot
```

Note that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.
```
python3.4 CloudBotRefresh/cloudbot/__main__.py
```
Specify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.
